# URL Shortener

## Project Overview

This project is a URL Shortener application built using React JS, Python Flask, and Firebase Database.

### Project Attribution

The idea for this project was inspired by Software Engineer UmaAbu, through his Full Stack Coding Project Ideas. While the code for various sections of the project is available on GitHub, I opted not to clone it directly. Instead, I studied the tools and implemented the project independently. The project is structured into two main directories: `client` and `server`.

### Client

The client directory contains a single-page React application, styled with Bootstrap, that allows users to input a long URL. The application then stores this URL in a Firebase database and provides the user with a generated short URL.

#### Dependencies

- Firebase Project Account
- Firebase Database within the Project Account
- Firebase configuration in `index.js` at line 12 (Note: The configuration details have been removed for security purposes. They can be retrieved from the Firebase Project under **Project Overview > Project Settings > General > Your Apps**).

#### Running the Client Locally

1. Install dependencies using `npm install` (Ensure you have a Firebase account).
2. Start the client application with `npm start`.

### Server

The server directory contains a Python Flask web server that listens for requests made with the generated short URL. It queries the database to retrieve the original long URL and then redirects the user to the corresponding web page.

#### Dependencies

- Firebase Project Account
- Firebase Database within the Project Account
- Firebase service account JSON key file (`ServiceAccountKey.json`) located in `server/app/main.py` at line 12 (This key can be regenerated by following **Project Overview > Project Settings > Service Accounts > Python > Generate New Private Key**).
- Firebase Database URL in `server/app/main.py` at line 11 (The URL can be found under **Realtime Database > Data**, in the center of the page).

#### Running the Server Locally

1. Create a virtual environment in the server folder using `python3 -m venv venv` (if not already created).
2. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal.
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - For macOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
   - For Windows: `venv/Scripts/activate`
4. Ensure the `ServiceAccountKey.json` file is present in the server directory.
5. Start the Flask application by running `python wsgi.py`.

The Flask app is configured to serve the production version of the React app, which should be located in the `app` folder for this functionality to work.

### Running the Entire System Locally

1. Start the client application and use it to shorten a URL.
2. Simultaneously, run the server application in a separate terminal.
3. Copy the shortened URL generated by the client.
4. Paste this URL into a browser, appending the shortened path or preferred alias after the `/`.
5. The browser will redirect to the original long URL.

Deploying the system to a cloud platform like Heroku or Azure would simplify these steps by eliminating the need to run the client and server locally. However, to avoid costs, I chose not to deploy the application. If deployed, the short URL generated would seamlessly redirect to the corresponding web page for the long URL.
